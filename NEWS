OpenSAF 5.20.02 (released 2020-02-15)
-------------------------------------

This is a major release containing new enhancements. Before installing or
upgrading to OpenSAF 5.20.02, make sure your system meets the minimum version
requirements of the following system components:

- Linux kernel, version 2.6.39 or later. Recommended version is Linux 3.18 or
  later when using the TCP transport, and Linux 4.4.22 or later when using the
  TIPC transport. Linux versions older than the recommended ones contain bugs
  that are known to affect the proper function of OpenSAF. Use of Linux versions
  older than the recommended ones together with OpenSAF is strongly discouraged.
- GNU C Library (Glibc), version 2.11 or later
- GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), version 4.8.1 or later
- Libxml2, version 2.7 or later
- Python, version 2.7 or later (only needed when configuring with
  --enable-python)
- Libopenssl, version 0.9.8 or later (optional)
- Systemd, version 219 or later (optional)
- Libsqlite3, version 3.6 or later (only needed when configuring with
  --enable-imm-pbe)
- OpenHPI, version 2.17.0 or later (only needed when configuring with
  --enable-ais-plm)
- Libvirt, version 0.9.7 or later (only needed when configuring with
  --enable-ais-plm)

When upgrading from OpenSAF version 5.1 or older, be aware that SMF upgrade
campaigns can behave differently compared to earlier OpenSAF releases in case of
component failures. This is because Section 4.2.1.3 of SMF spec A.01.02 was
implemented in OpenSAF 5.2.0. You can now disable this new feature in OpenSAF
5.17.07 by setting the attribute osafAmfRestrictAutoRepairEnable to 0 in the AMF
configuration object amfConfig=1,safApp=safAmfService.
